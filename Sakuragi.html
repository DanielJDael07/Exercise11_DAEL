        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <p>
            In his initial appearance, Sakuragi had short, distinctive, pompadour styled red hair with fringes at the center of his forehead, and brown eyes. After his loss against Kainan, he shaved his hair semi-bald as a vow that Shohoku will never lose again.

He wears a dark blue standard Shohoku winter school uniform from his initial appearance until their match against Shoyo. Later, he wears a white short sleeve loose shirt until he swaps to a white short sleeve openly loose button shirt.

During basketball training, Sakuragi wears a blue tank top, tucked into his white shorts, and his white running shoes with two blue linings. After his running shoes are destroyed in the end of the practice match against Ryonan, he first wore the Air Jordan 6 - "White Infrared" colorway. However, it also got broke due to his feet size increasing together with his height so he was forced to buy another one. This time, he bought the iconic Air Jordan 1 - "Bred" colorway, which was a great pick to match Shohoku's team color. Later, the color of his tank top was changed to black. His basketball jersey uniform is red and black and alternately red and white.

When he was still at Wakou Junior High School, Sakuragi's uniform was olive green, but in later flashbacks when he fought other delinquents from other schools, his uniform was purple.

Personality
Throughout the manga, he is very short-tempered, boisterous, arrogant, aggressive, rude, and immature. He begins regarding himself as a "genius" even though he has not learned any skills.

He can also be regarded as a 'cheap-shot artist', from slide tackles, tripping and not dribbling the basketball against Akagi , to low-blows and headbutts against members and Aota, despite being unaware that both are regarded as illegal fouls in the respective sports. He redeems himself by copying Takenori's standing rear naked choke (sleeper hold) after Takenori was dunked on his head, then choked Sakuragi afterwards. Sakragi ends the battle with an over-the-shoulder throw, a highly advanced and powerful maneuver.

He also prided himself as the "Rebound King" when his rebounding ability had just started to surface, which was accepted and considered as valid. His most recognizable trait is his red hair, which he shaves as reparation for an error that led to a loss in the interhigh tournament against Kainan.

Despite his violent nature and rude personality, Sakuragi has a soft spot for girls and is extremely vulnerable and sensitive to them. This was seen when he was unable to defend himself from Rukawa fan girls' provocations and insults. While talking with girls, Sakuragi always speaks in a formal and polite way. He also uses honorifics, as he always addresses Haruko as "Haruko-san", which is a way to address a person of higher status.

He is also a simple-minded and naive person. After their loss in the practice match against Ryonan, he felt a bit depressed. However, as soon as Haruko began to compliment him for his hard efforts in the match, he immediately returned to his senses. Another time, when Miyagi explained fakes in basketball, he showed amazement and described it as terrifying for deceiving opponents. His naivety and simple judgement earned him the nickname of "Simpleton King".

He is not the type to accept losses. His persistence started to get into Fukuda when he was totally outplayed at the first half of their game, though it was settled during the practice match against the combined team of Shoyo and Ryonan.

Sakuragi has a habit of making fun of other players by giving nicknames. He calls Akagi "Gorilla" or "Gori" (a nickname that catches on, much to Akagi's irritation), Uozumi "Boss monkey", Kiyota "Wild monkey", Maki "Uncle" or "Senior", Masahiro "Totem pole", Masashi Kawata "Bald Gori", Mikio Kawata "Meatball", Miyamasu "Alien" and Fujima "substitute" or "bench warmer". Despite this, the only one doing the same thing to Sakuragi is Kiyota who calls him "red haired monkey". The only one who was not given a nickname by him is Kaede Rukawa whom he considers his rival in basketball and love. However, he does sometimes calls him a "fox" or "sleeping fox" due to his sleepy nature. 

In spite of the setbacks he has had to face, Sakuragi displays a great deal of tenacity and determination that carry him through and helps compensate for his failings, both on and off the court. He also knows how to carry the will of others. These was shown when he told Kogure of postponing his retirement for a while because of him, who is a genius.

As a basketball player, he became a person with a great determination and resolve. Sakuragi began to gain respect from the audience during his dunk against Shoyo, and during the match against Sannoh, when he saved the ball from going out of bounds and injured his back, making the audience cheer for Shohoku. They managed to win everyone's heart with his determination and resolve. His determination to keep playing despite the back injury was the main factor for Shohoku's victory against Sannoh.

Although his love for Haruko and rivalry with Rukawa are the main driving forces motivating him to succeed in basketball, his injury during the Sannoh match made him realize that he has actually come to love basketball, leading him to give his all for the team and bring them victory.
